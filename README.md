update the variable named question in tester.cpp and remove the comment out form of the corresponding part and instead of running the code compiling the query again and again it is recommended to use a loop it answer the queries as it is going to be really good
### Syntax:
g++ -g -o tester Node.cpp qna_tool.cpp tester.cpp
for windows: .\tester
